# Lovelace views

This directory contains the different Lovelace UI views for my configuration

`note: Until now I haven't found a way to leverage the use of YAML anchors so that I can keep them in 1 single file, separate from the view files to prevent duplication. You will see the anchors defined in all the view files to prevent duplication within each of the files. However as it stands every view file will have to have the anchors defined within the scope of it's YAML document.
